  <a class="title" href="http://www.classy.org/">Classy</a> engages users for non-profit fundraising through their <a href="https://www.classy.org/crowdfunding-campaigns">fundraising platform</a> and the <a href="https://www.classy.org/collaborative">annual Collaborative</a>, ending in the <a href="https://www.classy.org/collaborative/awards-ceremony">Classy Awards</a>.

  As of March 1, I will be the engineering manager for <a href="https://www.classyawards.org/classy-awards/progress">Classy's new data platform, called Progress</a>. Progress is a unique database about the what, where, why ,and how of non-profit problem-solving. We are not exactly sure of what Progress will become, but we are certain it will help re-define how people engage with non-profits.

  Through this work, we were able to extend Khan Academy's work to the populations that needed it the most--those with few teacher and education resources also have little streaming-capable Internet connectivity. I led a partnership with the <a href="https://www.idoc.idaho.gov/">Idaho Department of Correction</a> and <a href="https://www.nnu.edu/">Northern Nazarene University</a> to <a href="https://blog.learningequality.org/ka-lite-brings-offline-education-to-idaho-department-of-corrections-90f7a5f1bf4b">deploy KA Lite to prisoners</a>--who love the ability to work at their own speed and without judgment or worry for their current level. I also led a partnership with <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/">Stanford Medicine</a> to develop and deploy a Khan Academy / Stanford Medicine hybrid system that we <a href="https://medium.com/@mrquickowl/videos-for-gitwe-a1768dfc321b">deployed in Gitwe, Rwanda</a> to the first private medical school in the country.

  <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> is a pioneer in education, developing a system for
  students to progress at their own pace through use of online lectures and
  self-grading exercises. They provide tools for teachers to be come coaches--moving
  away from content-providers, and towards enablers of students' self-education.
</p>


<p>
  I was the software development lead, and lead developer, for <a class="title" href="http://learningequality.com/">Learning Equality</a>, where we built an installable "light" version of the Khan Academy experience (<a href="http://www.learninequality.com/kalite/">KA Lite</a>). This installable version was efficient enough to work on portable, socketless hardware systems (e.g. <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a> powered by a solar panel). We open-sourced the platform, allowing hundreds of agencies to install and deploy the Khan Academy experience to places with limited electricity and Internet access.

  In addition, KA Lite is able to collect back user usage data, any time the system
  gets online. So much can be done with them to understand learning patterns across culture and location!
