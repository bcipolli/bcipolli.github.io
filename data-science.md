<p>
  I've seen a gap in understanding about what data science is - when talking with students, with non-technical leaders, and even with people working within data science.
</p>

<p>
  I feel confident that I know what data science is. I've <a href="/private-sector/#classy">built a data science department at a small company</a>, and had to articulate what data science is (and is not!) to company leaders. Now, I am working as a <a href="/private-sector/#facebook">data science lead at a very large company</a>, and see how roles and responsibilities are being divvy'd up. And before, during, and after all of this, I have participated in the <a href="#disciplines">data science stack</a> at essentially all levels.
</p>

<p>
  There are three core ideas that I want to share. I recently tried to articulate this via a <a href="https://podcast.ucsd.edu/watch/fa19/cogs108_a00/2/screen">talk in Prof. Brad Voytek's class "Data Science in Practice"</a>. I've updated and consolidated those initial ideas here.

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#what">What is data science?</a></li>
    <li><a href="#disciplines">What are the core disciplines of data science?</a></li>
    <li><a href="#responsibilites">What are the core responsibilities of a data scientist?</a></li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  <a name="what"></a>
  <h4><br/></h4>
  <h4>What is data science?</h4>
</p>

<p>
  Let me start by telling you <b>what data science is not</b>. Data science <b><i>is not</i> machine learning</b>. It <b><i>is not</i> predictive modeling</b>, <b><i>nor is</i> it statistics</b>. <b><i>It's not</i> data preparation</b>, and it's <b><i>surely not</i> engineering</b>.
</p>

<p>
  Instead, <b>Data science is all of that and more</b>. A <i>"full stack" data scientist</i> will do many, most, or all disciplines; being at a small company, you'll take on more of those roles. At larger companies, data scientists will specialize into one or two disciplines.
</p>

<p>
  <h4><br/></h4>
  <a name="disciplines"></a>
  <h4>What are the core data science disciplines?</h4>
</p>

<p>
  Data science can be broken into:

  <ul>
    <li><b>Data engineering</b> - Building systems / processes to get raw data (internal or external), prepare it for consumption, and to build systems to enable robust access.</li>
    <li><b>Data analytics</b> - Assessing the state of a product, system, or process. Typically includes building dashboards, reports, or other communication tools. Think "BI", but with skills to do much, much more.</li>
    <li><b>Machine learning engineer (MLE)</b> - Software engineer that builds models (i.e. codes & trains) for deployment to production.</li>
    <li><b>Research scientist</b> - Unlike analytics and MLEs, isn't usually tied to a specific project. Instead, is doing topical research (related to a product or algorithm), assessment, and outputs that help enable others at the company. May also publish (typically in academic journals / conference proceedings) as well.</li>
  </ul>
</p>


<p>
  <h4><br/></h4>
  <a name="responsibilities"></a>
  <h4>What are the core responsibilities of a data scientist?</h4>
</p>

<p>
  Most data scientists are data analysts, first and foremost. This is because what companies need first is to get new insight on improving the business, via data.
</p>

<p>As a data scientist, our core responsibility is to <b>be impactful</b> - to change the trajectory of what a company is doing, for the better. To do that, follow these three core reponsibilities:

  <ul>
    <li><b>Be interesting</b> - As a data scientist, if you're saying things that don't surprise people, you're not doing your core job. At companies, we have a pretty good idea on what's going on most of the time. There's no need to involve expensive and slow data science in those cases. Data super powers should be focused in the places where we're not sure what's going on, or when we have a hunch that we think the wrong thing, or we worry that things might be changing.</li>

    <li><b>Be right</b> - This is the core of what most data scientists think about - how to get the right data and right algorithms to answer questions via data.</li>

    <li><b>Be persuasive</b> - What's the point of being right about something interesting & controversial, if you can't get decision-makers at your company on board? Hint: there is none. Being persuasive may or may not involve presenting data, but it definitely involves knowing your audience and speaking to them wherever they are, with whatever they need to hear.</li>
  </ul>
