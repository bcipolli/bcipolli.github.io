	<b><u>Measuring lateralization</u></b> -
Currently, lateralized function
in the brain is measured behaviorally, through brain damage, or through
visible differences in neuroimaging (ERP: different waveforms; fMRI: difference
in number or intensity of activated voxels)
</p>

<p>We are currently using multivariate approaches to see:
<ul>
	<li>Relationships between different asymmetries in the brain. When
	one part of the brain is asymmetric, are any others areas always
	asymmetric too?</li>
	<li>Representational similarity analysis (RSA) - forget whether
	the two sides are active to the same level. Is the pattern of activations
	across all stimuli similar on the left and right sides, or are they
	computing different things?</li>
</ul>
