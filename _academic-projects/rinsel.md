<p>
    <b><u>Interhemispheric connectivity across species</u></b><br/>
    It has been argued that the hemispheres
    are asymmetric particularly in humans because our hemispheres are more independent than in other
    mammals.  We hypothesize that the opposite must be true - in order for the two sides to do
    different things, they <i>must</i> be able to talk with each other.
    </p>

<p>
	In this project, <b>we showed that a connectivity between the two hemispheres is stable across species, and is in fact stronger than the average connection.</b> In the process, we shoed that previous reports of decreased connectivity between the hemispheres
    in large-brained animals were based on incorrect assumptions.
</p>

<p>
    The previous report measured brain-related surface areas from 13 primate species
    to estimate connections counts.
    We mined the literature for values needed to estimate actual connection counts from the
    surface area data.

<p>
    To mine the data, I manually annotated over 20 figures from the literature,
    then implementing basic image parsing code to estimate values from the figures. I
    validated the data by comparing summary statistics of my parsed data to those reported
    in the figure, as well as re-creating the figures. All <a href="https://github.com/bcipolli/CallosalData">data and code</a> have been posted to Github.
