  In April of 2013, I got involved with a newly-formed non-profit organization with
  the goal to bring the explosive growth of freely available digital educational materials
  to the offline world.  The issues are important, the <a href="http://www.learningequality.org/about/team">FLE team</a>
  rocks, and I wound up becoming the Software Development Lead (and Implementations Liaison).
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://kalite.learningequality.org">KA Lite</a>, our first software product, is an installable, offline server
  that offers the basic content, reporting, and mastery-based learning
  of <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> to students who don't have sufficient access to the
  internet to otherwise leverage these resources.
</p>
<p>
  Since then, I've contributed to a number of initiatives, including:
  <ul>
    <li>
        Sharing our first software platform <a href="http://kalite.learningequality.org">KA Lite</a>
        with offenders within Idaho prisons as part of the <a href="http://www.khanidaho.org/">Khan in Idaho</a> initiative
        (<a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3018668/idaho-prisoners-use-khan-academy-offline-to-get-geds">write-up in Fast Company</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
        Extending our platform to share <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/">Stanford Medicine</a> videos alongside the
        <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> content
        to support the <a href="https://medium.com/because-rwanda/a1768dfc321b">launch of Rwanda's first private medical school</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Implementing <a href="https://learningequality.org/blog/2014/ka-lite-internationalization-coming-soon/">internationalization of KA Lite</a>, as not all students wanting
        to learn understand English :)
    </li>
</ul>
