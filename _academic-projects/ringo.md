    <b><u>Time delays and development</u> (<a href="http://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0086/index.html">COGSI 2013</a>)</b> - We use a recurrent neural network in time
    to show that effects of time delays, when predictable, are highly over-stated--they
    can be overcome through predictive learning, one of the fundamental features of the brain.
</p>
<p>
	In this project, we argue that unreliable time delays cannot be overcome by
    such means, suggest that unreliable delays exist early in mammalian development,
    and argue that this effect is exacerbated more in humans than any other animal.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Current project</b>: The Ringo model never actually <b>tested</b> whether
	varying interhemispheric projections affects lateralization. We are testing
	this by using RSA--representational similarity analysis--to see whether
	information in each hemisphere is more or less similar as we manipulate
	connections between them.
