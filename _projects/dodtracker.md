<p>
  In October 2007, I created a concept website to aggregate "deal of the day" offers across the web.
  Without expecting it, a bunch of people found my site and shared it, and a business was born.
  I expanded the website, and at its peak it had ~15,000 page-views per day.
</p>
<p>
  As CEO and sole operator, I was responsible for all aspects of the site--both coding of the site
  (the aggregation code, website layout, creating feed to allow others to rev-share my data, discovering new deals)
  as well as finances (taking on advertising partners, setting up revenue sharing, even billing...).
</p>
<p>
  In 2010, I sold the website to <a href="http://www.internetbrands.com/">Internet Brands</a> in order to focus on
  my dissertation!
