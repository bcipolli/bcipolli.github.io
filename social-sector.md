  <a class="title" href="http://www.classy.org/">Classy</a> engages users for non-profit fundraising through their <a href="https://www.classy.org/crowdfunding-campaigns">fundraising platform</a> and the <a href="https://www.classy.org/collaborative">annual Collaborative</a>, ending in the <a href="https://www.classy.org/collaborative/awards-ceremony">Classy Awards</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I am an engineering manager at Classy, where I founded the "Data Insights" team. We use data science to understand non-profit fundraising, and to build next-generation tools within the fundraising product.
  We publish results from these to Classy's <a href="https://www.classy.org/blog/">marketing</a> and <a href="https://devblog.classy.org/">developer</a> blogs.
</p>

<p>
  I joined Classy in 2016 as the engineering manager for <a href="https://progress.classy.org/">Progress</a>,
  Classy's effort to help non-profits express their social impact through storytelling as well as success metrics grounded in well-defined problem and strategy information. This framework is used for the <a href="https://www.classy.org/collaborative/awards-ceremony">Classy Awards</a>, an event for recognizing innovative and effective non-profit programs.

<h4>Learning Equality</h4>

<img class="col one right" src="{{ '/img/logos/leq.png' | prepend:site.baseurl }}">

<p>
  <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> is a pioneer in education, developing a system for
  students to progress at their own pace through use of online lectures and
  self-grading exercises. They provide tools for teachers to be come coaches--moving
  away from content-providers, and towards enablers of students' self-education.
</p>


<p>
  I was the software development lead, and lead developer, for <a class="title" href="http://learningequality.com/">Learning Equality</a>, where we built an installable "light" version of the Khan Academy experience (<a href="http://www.learninequality.com/kalite/">KA Lite</a>). This installable version was efficient enough to work on portable, socketless hardware systems (e.g. <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a> powered by a solar panel). We open-sourced the platform, allowing hundreds of agencies to install and deploy the Khan Academy experience to places with limited electricity and Internet access.
</p>

<p>
  Through this work, we were able to extend Khan Academy's work to the populations that needed it the most--those with few teacher and education resources also have little streaming-capable Internet connectivity. I led a partnership with the <a href="https://www.idoc.idaho.gov/">Idaho Department of Correction</a> and <a href="http://www.nnu.edu/">Northwest Nazarene University</a> to <a href="https://learningequality.org/blog/2013/ka-lite-brings-offline-education-idaho-department-/">deploy KA Lite to prisoners</a>--who love the ability to work at their own speed and without judgment or worry for their current level. I also led a partnership with <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/">Stanford Medicine</a> to develop and deploy a Khan Academy / Stanford Medicine hybrid system that we <a href="https://medium.com/@mrquickowl/videos-for-gitwe-a1768dfc321b#.q08kp38iz">deployed in Gitwe, Rwanda</a> to the first private medical school in the country.
</p>

<p>
  In addition, KA Lite is able to collect back user usage data, any time the system
  gets online. So much can be done with them to understand learning patterns across culture and location!
