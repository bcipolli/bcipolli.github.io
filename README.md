# Ben Cipollini's website.

This website was built from the `*folio` Jekyll theme (<a href="http://liabogoev.com/-folio">live *folio demo</a>). Jekyll is a Ruby-on-rails gem that Github supports; if you create a repository called `[your-username].github.io` and commit a Jekyll project to the `master` branch, Github will build the website for you and host it--cool!
