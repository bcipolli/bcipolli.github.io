description: I gave a talk at the <a href="http://lajollalibrary.org/">La Jolla Public Library</a> titled "<a href="http://mrquickowl.com/post/132501847718/a-mostly-true-history-of-the-human-half-brain">A Mostly True History of the Human Half-Brain</a>". The hangout-on-air failed (slow library WiFi), but I will re-record soon and post a blog as well.
