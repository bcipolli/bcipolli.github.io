title: A Developmental Model of Hemispheric Asymmetry of Spatial Frequencies
date: 2014-07-25
description: I gave this talk at the Cognitive Science Society's 34th Annual meeting. It describes the <a href="{{ '/academia/projects/differential-encoding/' | prepend:site.baseurl }}">differential encoding model</a>, which explains how the two sides of the brain "see" differently through a connectivity difference in visual cortex. We show here that this connectivity difference can arise through typical development if, as postulated elsewhere, the right visual cortex begins maturing earlier than the left visual cortex.
