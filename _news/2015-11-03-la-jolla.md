title: First public lecture
date: 2015-11-03
description: I gave a talk at the <a href="http://lajollalibrary.org/">La Jolla Public Library</a> titled "<a href="">A Mostly True History of the Human Half-Brain</a>". The hangout-on-air failed (slow library WiFi), but I will re-record soon and post a blog as well.
