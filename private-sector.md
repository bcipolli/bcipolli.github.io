  In the words of Gordon Gecko: "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF_iorX_MAw#t=2m37s">greed... is good.</a> ... Greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge, has marked the upward surge of mankind." Greed can be harmful and hateful, but in the right hands, greed for knowledge, the moral right, and power can be the most uplifting force in humanity.

  While in <a href="{{ '/academia/' | prepend:site.baseurl }}">graduate school</a>, I started my own business to <span style="text-decoration: line-through">supplement my</span>have an income. My view is that, I should get as much money as possible, so I can do as much good as possible. Money is an enabler, and I would prefer to <a href="{{ '/non-profit/#classy' | prepend:site.baseurl }}">find jobs that pay well and lead to good</a>--allowing me to have impact through my work and expenditures--rather than <a href="{{ '/non-profit/#leq' | prepend:site.baseurl }}">doing good with little pay</a>, reducing my impact to what I do and not how I spend.

  I an early data-driven website called DODTracker.com in 2007. The website scraped deal information from every daily deal on the 'net, from <a href="http://www.woot.com/">Woot.com</a> to
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/goldbox">Amazon.com's Daily Lightning Deal</a>.
  From this daily database, updated to-the-minute, I hosted a website and provided data feeds for selected parnters to share.

<p>
  I was able to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/28/internet-brands-snaps-up-experthub-network/">sell the website to Internet Brands</a>, who ran it for a few years before it fell into disrepair and was closed. Such is the life when scraping HTML from 500+ deals--maintenance is key!
